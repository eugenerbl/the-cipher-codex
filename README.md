Immerse yourself into the world of cryptography with our interactive, easy-to-use tools for encrypting and decrypting messages. Explore popular ciphers like Caesar, Vigen√®re, and Atbash, along with detailed explanations on how these ciphers work.


## üíª Framework
This site was made using the [React](https://react.dev) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) framework. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS were used to build the site components. The site also uses the following external libraries and dependencies:

- [React Router Dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) for routing
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/) for common components and CSS
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui) for common components and CSS


## üõ† Getting started

Note: Vite requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 18+ or 20+. This project also requires [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm), which is normally installed with Node.js. It is recommended to use a Node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Linux/Mac) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) to install and manage Node.js and npm.

There are two options to clone the repository:

1. Use `git clone`:
```
git clone https://github.com/eugenerbl/the-cipher-codex.git
```
2. Use [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to clone to your machine with an empty git history:

```
npm degit eugenerbl/the-cipher-codex#main my-app
```

Then install dependencies and run the application:
```
# enter the project directory
cd my-app

# install dependencies
npm install

# run application
npm run dev
```

Then you can open `http://localhost:5173` (your port may be different depending on your settings) to view it in the browser.


## ‚öôÔ∏èCommand Line Interface

Other command line commands are available using the default npm scripts located in `package.json`:

```
npm vite build   // build for production
npm vite preview // locally preview production build
```
   
You can specify additional CLI options like `--port` or `--open`. For a full list of CLI options, run `npm vite --help` in your project.
